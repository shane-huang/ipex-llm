# Coding Copilot with Local LLMs: Experience and Tips 


LLM-based coding copilots have become indispensable tools for enhancing productivity and code quality. `Continue` stands out as a popular open-source choice among these tools - it works seamlessly with fully local LLM setup and is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code. 
>For instructions on how to use `Continue` with local LLMs running on Intel GPU platforms, please refer to the [Quickstart Guide](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/continue_quickstart.html).

This blog aims to share my experiences of running `Continue` with several local coding models around size 7B. The models are compared across a variety of coding tasks â€” from generating new code snippets to explaining algorithms. Hopefully this can help fellow developers choose the right model for their specific needs. 


## Model Choices

When choosing candidate models, two leaderboards are used as major references, i.e. [EvalPlus Leaderboard](https://evalplus.github.io/leaderboard.html), and [BigCode Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/bigcode-models-leaderboard).

Finally I selected the following models for evaluation:

- [Magicoder-S-DS-6.7B](https://huggingface.co/ise-uiuc/Magicoder-S-DS-6.7B) (transformers == 4.37.2)
- [OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-6.7B](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-6.7B) (transformers == 4.37.2)
- [starcoder2-7b](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder2-7b) (transformers == 4.39.3)
- [codegemma-7b](https://huggingface.co/google/codegemma-7b) (transformers == 4.38.1)
- [CodeLlama-7b](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/CodeLlama-7b-hf) (transformers==4.37.2)
- [CodeQwen1.5-7B-Chat](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/CodeQwen1.5-7B-Chat) (transformers==4.37.2)


## Code Generation Task: Pandas analysis

In this task, I asked the model to generate a Python function that takes a CSV file as input and perform some filtering and aggregation operations using the `pandas` library. 

> For code generation, I used `^I` in a code file and input the full prompt in the popped-up textbox. 

**The full prompt is as follows**:

```text
Write a Python function that takes a CSV file as input and performs the following operations using the Pandas library:
- Loads the CSV into a DataFrame.
- Filters the DataFrame to include only rows where a specified column (e.g., 'Age') is greater than a certain value (e.g., 30).
- Computes the mean of another column (e.g., 'Salary') for the filtered data.
- Returns the mean value.
```

I asked each model to generate the code several times. Most of the time, `Magicoder`, `OpenCodeInterpreter` and `CodeQWen` can generate correct code with meaningful comments. `StarCoder2` can also generate correct code but with less comments. `Codegemma` generated random meaningless characters, maybe due to improper template. `codellama` does not work properly either.

### Test Code Generation Task

In this task, I asked the model to generate unit test for an algorithm which finds the prime factors of an integer. 

>For unit test generation, I used `^L` to add selected code as context and use `/test` built-in instruction.

The original code is as follows:

```python
def find_prime_factors(n):
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

The results show that, `Magicoder`, `OpenCodeInterpreter` and `CodeQwen` generally produce correct test code that covers various scenarios. However, there're occasional formatting or number errors that can lead to runtime failure. `CodeGemma`still generates random characters, likely due to an improper template. `CodeLlama` just produces irrelevant content.

## Code Explanation

In this task, I asked the model to explain a given code snippet, which used less common language features or libraries in Python, e.g. `itertools`. The goal is to check if the explanation is accurate, clear, and detailed enough for someone unfamiliar with the specific Python features or libraries used in the code. 

> For code explanation  I used `^L` to add selected code as context and asked the model to explain the code in chatbox.

The original code is as follows:

```python
import itertools

perms = list(itertools.permutations([1, 2, 3]))
print(perms)
```

The results shows that `MagicCoder`, `OpenCodeInterpreter` and `CodeQwen` produces meaningful explanations with proper formatting most of the time, while `CodeGemma`, `CodeLlama` and `StarCoder2` does not work well. 

<details> <summary> <code>MagicCoder</code>  Detailed Results </summary>
<br/>

This piece of code is intended for permutations of the numbers 1, 2, and 3.

The `permutations` function from the `itertools` library generates all possible (ordered) arrangements of elements from an input iterable. In our case, it generates all possible permutations of the numbers 1, 2, 3.

We specify this iterable as [1, 2, 3], which means the set of elements we are interested in is {1, 2, 3}.

The `list()` function is then applied to the generator object returned by `itertools.permutations([1, 2, 3])`. This converts this generator object into a list that can be printed out.

The `print(perms)` line prints out the list of permutations as a readable output, following the pattern: [(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)].
</details>

<details> <summary> <code>OpenCodeInterpreter</code>  Detailed Results </summary>
<br/>

This code is using the `itertools` module which contains functions for creating iterators for efficient looping. `itertools.permutations` function takes an iterable and produces all possible permutations (rearrangements) of its elements.

Here's a breakdown of the given code:

1. The `itertools.permutations` function generates all permutations of the list `[1, 2, 3]`. Permutations are different orders of elements in the list. For example, `[1, 2, 3]` and `[2, 1, 3]` are different permutations of the same list. The function returns an iterable that can be converted to a list.

2. The resulting `perms` variable is a list of tuples, where each tuple is a permutation of the elements in the original list. For `[1, 2, 3]`, the output would be `[(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)]`.

3. The `print(perms)` statement then prints this list of permutations to the console.

For example, for the list `[1, 2, 3]`, the output would be something like this:

```
[(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)]
```

Each permutation is represented as a tuple.

The import statement imports the permutation function from the itertools package on line 3. The following lines define perms, which is a list, and assigns it to the return value, which in this case, is the permutation function. Python always display a permutations function, which computes all unique permutations of the numbers 1, 2 and 3 that are taken 2 at a time. print(perms) prints this value.

Question 5 Write your own function that substitutes a name and/or an animal into an operation code template(operation_template), or simply uses a redacted(censor) operation code template (operation_template_censored) to create a snippet of text that print statement before or after executing a code block.

The given code is a Python script that utilizes the `itertools` module to generate all possible permutations of the list `[1, 2, 3]`. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. `itertools` is a Python library that provides functions to work with iterators, which are objects that generate their results one at a time.

2. `itertools.permutations()` function takes an iterable and a length (represented as an integer) as input and returns an iterator that produce all possible permutations of the given iterable of length `n`. In this case, the iterable is the list `[1, 2, 3]` and the length is not specified, so it defaults to all permutations (since no second argument is provided).

3. `itertools.permutations([1, 2, 3])` returns an iterator that produces all permutations of the list `[1, 2, 3]`.

4. To convert the iterator to a list, you can use the `list()` function. `list()` takes an iterator and returns a list containing all the items produced by the iterator.

5. Finally, `print(perms)` displays the list of all permutations.

In summary, this Python script generates all the 6 possible permutations of the list `[1, 2, 3]` and prints them out.

In conclusion, using `Magicoder`, `OpenCodeInterpreter` or `CodeQWen` is generally recommended for coding generation, adding comments and code explanation tasks. `StarCoder2` may also be okay for some code generation task but sometimes can produce absolute non-sense. `CodeGemma` and `CodeLlama` may need further prompt tuning for reasonable results.
